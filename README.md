## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset used is [`Retail Transactions.csv`](./Retail%20Transactions.csv), which contains the following fields:

- `Invoice ID`
- `Branch`, `City`
- `Customer type`, `Gender`
- `Product line`
- `Unit price`, `Quantity`, `Tax 5%`, `Total`
- `Date`, `Time`
- `Payment`
- `cogs`, `gross income`, `gross margin %`
- `Rating`

> üìå The file is located in the root of this repository for testing and local use.

   - Data preview checked for structure and correctness.

2. **Data Formatting**
   - Dates parsed using `Date#()` and `Date()` functions.
